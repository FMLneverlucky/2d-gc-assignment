ahahahaha watch me slack and rush last min

movement keys:
A - move left
D - move right
space - jump/ double jump

how the game works:
player start with base health bar/ light bar (health)
to be able to double jump, player need wing wedges (lives)
to get wing wedges, player need to find light (trees) scattered around the map

things that dont work yet:
enemy knockback player
getting first wedge -> wedge (life) count keeps having value bug(jumping between 0 and 1) -> player can perform infinite double jumps
